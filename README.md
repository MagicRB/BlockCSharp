# BlockCSharp

This is a project which attemps to recreate Mojang's Minecraft Java in C#.
Becuase this is open-source, it allows modder's to support PR to BlockCSharp.
This project is very early in its development, and there are only a few things actually working.
I'll try to support loading Anvil formated worlds, in the near future, and then maybe down the line,
multiplayer with compatibility with MC Java multiplayer protocols, but there will also be a new protocol developed specifically for this game.
And really maybe, a jni4net layer which would implement a Forge like API for loading Java mods, this is incredibly unlikely to work, but it might.
